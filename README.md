## Welcome to WaterMene V2! 

This version of WaterMene has been completely reimagined and rebuilt from the ground up, offering a custom engine specialized in Menes. 

This sounds cool an doesn't mean much, but While the previous version, V1, relied on Watermark.js, we have developed a new solution to provide enhanced functionality and improved performance.

## About the Project
WaterMene V2 is built using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) bundler and the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager. 

To run the project on your local machine, ensure you have (Node.js 18)[https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v18.x/] installed. 

Follow the steps below to get started:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18

### Installation
1. Install pnpm globally by running the following command:
   ```
   $ npm i -g pnpm
   ```

2. Install project dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   $ pnpm install
   ```

### Development


Start the development server by running the following command:

```
$ pnpm dev
```

This will launch the application and display a URL in your terminal. You can open this URL in your browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger a screen refresh.

### Building for Production
To generate a publishable version of the application, run the following command:
```
$ pnpm build
```
This command will generate a `dist` folder containing the optimized and bundled version of the application. You can then upload this folder to a static server for deployment.

### Deployment with GitHub Pages
If you fork this repository, you can easily deploy the application using GitHub Pages. Follow the steps below:

1. Enable GitHub Pages for your forked repository.
2. Create a release by uploading a tag.
3. When a new tag is created, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the application.
